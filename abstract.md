2023 had some spectacular public software failures like the UK air traffic
control failure of September which cancelled more than 2,000 flights cancelled
due to “an extremely rare set of circumstances” involving two identically named
but separate waypoint markers.

For any software project, the potential presence of certain bugs is a
cost-risk-benefit proposition. How much time can one spend to ensure
catastrophic failure does not happen?

Property Based Testing (PBT) is a technique which seems to uncover many bugs
compared to the effort needed. It can also be incorporated early in the
development process which decreases the effort required to debug.

This presentation looks at the hypothesis property based testing tool used in
our Scientific Computing team at Equinor. We look at how it compares to
traditional testing methods and verification techniques, and how we use PBT in
our team.
